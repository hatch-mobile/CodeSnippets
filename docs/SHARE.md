    ///
    /// I found this documentation to be somewhat of a disappointment because most of the cool stuff is only supported in `Swift Playgrounds`.
    /// I tried them all and paired them with related `Placeholders` to produce a set of `Code Snippets`. I use the all the time
    /// and wanted to share.
